Feature:Sub categories sorting
    As a REST API endpoint consumer,
  I want to validate the category tree and ensure that subcategories are sorted alphabetically.

  Background:
    Given that I am on the domain "http://localhost:4000"

 Scenario: Get a list of all categories
    When I visit the endpoint "GET" "/api/leftMenu/categorytree"
    Then the status code of the response should be 200
    And the response time should be below 1000 milliseconds
    And there should be at least 10 main categories


  Scenario Outline: Checking subcategories sorting alphabetically
    When I visit the endpoint "GET" "/api/c/{categoryUrlPart}?size=70&page=0&sort=name-asc"
    Then the status code of the response should be 200
    And the response time should be below 1000 milliseconds
    And sub categories should be sorted by alphabetically

    # Use dynamic data (from a previous scenario) to run a scenario outline multiple times!
    # See the step definitions:
    # 1) Set an array of string values in your step definitions for
    #    the previous scenario! (In our case: this.categoryUrlParts)
    # 2) Use the syntax below to point to your array
    # 3) Use the same name in singular in curly brackets in a string in your step (see above)
    Examples:
      | {dynamic: 'categoryUrlParts'} |
