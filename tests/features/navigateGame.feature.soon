Feature: Klick on a play button
  As a user I want to be able to navigate the game through the buttons in the footer nav-bar.

  Scenario: At the right place with the right starting values
    Given that I have started the game at "http://localhost:3000"
    And that my position is "outside the cafe"
    Then the value of my "Health" should be 50
    And the value of my "Money" should be 10
    And the value of my "Espressos" should be 0
    And my hipster bag should contain "nothing cool"
